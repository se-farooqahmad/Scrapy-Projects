The respirator is designed for use for particles such as those from grinding, sanding, sweeping, sawing, bagging or other dusty operations. This respirator can also help reduce inhalation exposures to certain airborne biological particles (examples: mold, bacillus anthracis, mycobacterium tuberculosis), but cannot eliminate the risk of contracting infection, illness or disease. The respirator incorporates 3M proprietary technology with advanced electrostatically charged microfiber filter media designed for ease of breathing. This respirator is compatible with a variety of protective eyewear and hearing protection. Fitted with a 3M cool flow exhalation valve, this respirator is ideally suited for work situations involving heat, humidity or long periods of wear. The proprietary 3M cool flow valve is designed to release hot, humid exhaled breath quickly, helping to prevent an unpleasant build up of heat inside the facepiece a significant cause of discomfort to respirator wearers. The cool flow valve’s efficiency in keeping breathing cool and comfortable has been demonstrated through testing the atmosphere inside a respirator with a cool flow valve is on average 7.5&#176;F cooler than the similar product without the valve. This makes cool flow valve respirators ideal for long periods of wear, especially where conditions are hot, humid or physically demanding. Testing conducted in a 3M laboratory.

The specially formulated cermet (Ceramic and Metallic) teeth provide high heat tolerances and increased hardness for superior wear and ultimate cutting life. Featuring a special triple chip grind and perma-shield coating, these blades slice through the toughest of metals to produce precise cuts with less sparks and burr-free finishes that require no rework. The ability to cut through both mild and stainless steel eliminates the need for individually dedicated saw blades, offering a one-blade solution for ultimate metal cutting performance and unmatched value story, forever changing the metal cutting industry.
Laser Cut Arbor reduces vibration and premature wear for accurate blade rotation when in use
Laser cut arbor reduces vibration and premature wear for accurate blade rotation when in use on the saw
Up to 50X cooler cuts with a circular saw blade when compared to a grinding disc that increases temperature of steel by up to 500 degrees. Grinding discs increase the temperature enough to permanently discolor the steel.
Up to 10X faster cuts with a circular saw blade for maximum productivity and efficiency, resulting in up to 60 seconds faster cuts in both metals and stainless steels versus standard grinding discs
Triple Chip Cutting action reduces sparks and the possibility of needing hot permits
Optimized blade design reduces wandering and deflection of metal, creating precise cuts that require virtually no re-work
Advanced Laser Cut Stabilizer Vents trap noise and vibration for maximum stability, keeping the blade cool for straight, accurate cuts
Tri-Metal Shock Resistant Brazing, a three-metal brazing system, allows Cermet II teeth to withstand extreme impact for maximum durability
Laser Cut Thin Kerf Design provides less resistance and heat build-up for ease of cut, accuracy and long cutting life in cordless or corded saws
Perma-SHIELD coating resists heat build-up by protecting the blade against gumming and corrosion","What's Included:

It&#39;s a great match for cleanups ranging from draining flooded dishwashers, to cleaning out a vehicle, boat or RV, to picking up broken glass, dirt or debris from a home renovation.  This wet dry vacuum easily stores away with its compact size and on-board hose, accessory and power cord organizers that reduce overall storage space. Swivel casters let you get around easily, while the rear wheels keep the vac upright on rough surfaces.  This 6 gallon shop vacuum also features on-board hose storage plus accessory and power cord organizers that help eliminate unneeded hassle and reduce overall storage space. The Qwik Lock Filter Fastening System makes removing and installing wet dry vacuum filters quick, easy and secure. *Gallons indicated reflect drum volume, not necessarily collection capacity, actual capacity dependent upon type of debris collected, condition of filter and other factors. Peak horsepower represents a level at or below the maximum horsepower output of an electric motor tested in a laboratory using a dynamometer.

It has a nitrogen spring mechanism, Powerstate brushless motor, and Redlink Intelligence, providing pneumatic performance and cordless convenience. The framing nailer can sink full round head nails into dense engineered lumber to tackle the most demanding framing applications. To increase productivity and efficiency, the framing gun fires 3 nails per second with zero ramp-up time, firing a nail as soon as the trigger is pulled. The cordless framing nailer uses only Milwaukee&#39;s Redlithium batteries and sealed compressed nitrogen to drive each nail. The M18 Fuel 30 degree framing nailer delivers pneumatic performance and durability that professional carpenters and remodelers expect, without the hassle of a compressor and hose or gas cartridge.
Power to sink nails in engineered lumber
No gas cartridge required - completely battery operated
Sequential and contact actuation firing modes
Tool free drive depth adjustment
No-mark tip cover - ensure the nails are driven securely without causing any damage to the surrounding material

Our compact, lightweight design provides users with access to tight stud bays and improved ergonomics when stapling overhead or during difficult-to-reach situations. Moveable cable guides ensure proper alignment and the coil-spring mechanism consistently sinks the staples to the appropriate depth when fastening NM-B sheathed cable (14, 12, 10 AWG) and low voltage cables, supporting peak stapling productivity. Only compatible with our 1 in. insulated staples (sold separately), the M12 cable stapler gives the user the run-time needed to sink up to 1,200 staples on a fully charged M12 CP2.0ah battery.
Improves speed of staple installation, completing rough-ins 2x faster than when using a hammer
Staple viewing window - monitor remaining staple supply and time to reload
Battery fuel gauge - knowing how much battery life you have left allows you to plan your work schedule effectively

By leveraging a nitrogen spring mechanism, Powerstate brushless motor and Redlink Intelligence, this nailer provides users with pneumatic performance and the convenience and freedom of cordless power. Delivering the power to sink full round head nails into dense engineered lumbers, this framing nailer enables users to tackle even the most demanding framing applications. To keep users productive and efficient throughout the day, the framing gun fires 3 nails per second with zero ramp-up time, meaning a nail is fired as soon as the user pulls the trigger. Additionally, the cordless framing nailer operates using only Milwaukee&#39;s Redlithium Batteries (sold seperately) and sealed compressed nitrogen to drive each nail, completely eliminating the cost of gas cartridges and maintenance associated with competitors&#39; nailers. The M18 Fuel 21 degree framing nailer delivers the pneumatic performance and durability that professional carpenters and remodelers expect, without the hassle of a compressor and hose or gas cartridge.
Cost-effective - eliminates the ongoing expense of gas cartridges
Dry fire lockout - prevents accidental firing without nails loaded
On board hex key storage
Sequential and contact actuation firing modes
Tool free drive depth adjustment
REDLINK PLUS intelligence - provides optimized performance and overload protection using total system communication between tool, battery and charger
