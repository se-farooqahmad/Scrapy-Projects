Lag screw bolts are used in place of standard wood screws whenever the mounting surface must bear a heavy load. The hex head allows for lag screws to be tightened with more torque than can be used on Phillips head screws, though a pilot hole is still required prior to installation. Note that lag screws do not accept nuts as they are technically thick heavy duty wood screws with threads designed to cut into wood. They are ideal for use on decks since installation can be accomplished without having access to both ends of the fastener, as opposed to standard hex bolts that require a nut on the opposite end.
Highlights:
- Used on wood posts or studs
- Use a size smaller drill bit for pilot holes
- Steel construction offers long-lasting use and solid performance
Size: 3/8 inch X 3-1/2 inch Heavy duty wood screw with 6 sided hex bolt head Features deep wood screw threads and does not accept a nut Used in applications where standard wood screws cannot support the load (deck building, etc.) Requires pilot hole to be drilled and installs using wrench or socket tool Thread Type: Deep, Point Style: Gimlet Specification(s) Met: ASME B18.2.1 and ASTM A307A

Hardware / Fasteners / Screws / Lag Bolts,Prime-Line,9055705,A307 Grade A Zinc Plated Steel 5/16 in. x 3 in.

Lag screw bolts are used in place of standard wood screws whenever the mounting surface must bear a heavy load. The hex head allows for lag screws to be tightened with more torque than can be used on Phillips head screws, though a pilot hole is still required prior to installation. Note that lag screws do not accept nuts as they are technically thick heavy duty wood screws with threads designed to cut into wood. They are ideal for use on decks since installation can be accomplished without having access to both ends of the fastener, as opposed to standard hex bolts that require a nut on the opposite end.
Highlights:
- Used on wood posts or studs
- Use a size smaller drill bit for pilot holes
- Steel construction offers long-lasting use and solid performance
Size: 5/16 inch X 3 inch Heavy duty wood screw with 6 sided hex bolt head Features deep wood screw threads and does not accept a nut Used in applications where standard wood screws cannot support the load (deck building, etc.) Requires pilot hole to be drilled and installs using wrench or socket tool Thread Type: Deep, Point Style: Gimlet Specification(s) Met: ASME B18.2.1 and ASTM A307A

The name ""hex cap screw"" and ""hex bolt"" are commonly interchanged.
Highlights:
- For use in construction, agricultural, and automotive projects
- Stainless steel provides a polished look and corrosion protection
- Hex cap head and machine threads combine to handle higher torque
An alternative for using them without nuts is to install them directly into a compatible internally threaded hole A hex cap screw is actually manufactured with tighter tolerances and can be used anywhere a hex bolt is used Thread type: coarse Stainless steel

Hex bolts are one of the most common fasteners and can be used in a wide variety of applications. The 6 sided head makes them easy to install using a standard wrench or socket tool. Nuts and washers are not included, so will need to be purchased separately. Washers help to evenly distribute the load and should always be used under the bolt head and under the nut (just under the bolt head if installing into a threaded hole). Flat washers and finished/standard hex nuts work great for most applications, though if the bolt may be subject to excessive vibration, it is recommended that lock washers and lock nuts be used instead.
Highlights:
- Installs easily with most wrenches
- Designed to be used with the same sized nut
- Steel construction offers long-lasting use and solid performance

Hex bolts are one of the most common fasteners and can be used in a wide variety of applications. The 6 sided head makes them easy to install using a standard wrench or socket tool. Nuts and washers are not included, so will need to be purchased separately. Washers help to evenly distribute the load and should always be used under the bolt head and under the nut (just under the bolt head if installing into a threaded hole). Flat washers and finished/standard hex nuts work great for most applications, though if the bolt may be subject to excessive vibration, it is recommended that lock washers and lock nuts be used instead.
Highlights:
- Installs easily with most wrenches
- Designed to be used with the same sized nut
- Stainless steel construction offers rust-resistant performance
Size: 3/8 inch-16 X 6 inch One of the most common and versatile fasteners Designed for use with a nut or a threaded hole of the same diameter and thread size Features a 6 sided head and can be fastened using a wrench or socket tool Nuts and washers not included Thread type: coarse, thread class: UNC-2A, point style: blunt Specification(s) met: ASME B18.2.1 and ASTM F593

Lag Screws are used to fasten wood-to-wood and metal-to-wood, attach objects to wood, and affix items to concrete and masonry when combined with lag expansion shields. They are heavy-duty wood screws that are available in larger sizes both in terms of diameter and length and usually have a hex head to facilitate higher installation torque using a wrench. While lateral strength is lower than a comparable bolt and nut, lag screws are useful when access to one side of the joint is limited, the appearance of a nut is undesirable or through-bolt length is excessive.
Highlights:

Hex head is easily driven with simple wrenches and requires minimal clearance above the fastener Common applications include retaining walls, deck frames, and outdoor play equipment Stainless-steel material Use in pre-drilled hole

Hex bolts are one of the most common fasteners and can be used in a wide variety of applications. The 6 sided head makes them easy to install using a standard wrench or socket tool. Nuts and washers are not included, so will need to be purchased separately. Washers help to evenly distribute the load and should always be used under the bolt head and under the nut (just under the bolt head if installing into a threaded hole). Flat washers and finished/standard hex nuts work great for most applications, though if the bolt may be subject to excessive vibration, it is recommended that lock washers and lock nuts be used instead.
Highlights:
- Installs easily with most wrenches
- Designed to be used with the same sized nut
- Stainless steel construction offers rust-resistant performance
Size: 1/2 inch-13 X 2-1/2 inch One of the most common and versatile fasteners Designed for use with a nut or a threaded hole of the same diameter and thread size Features a 6 sided head and can be fastened using a wrench or socket tool Nuts and washers not included Thread type: coarse, thread class: UNC-2A, point style: blunt Specification(s) met: ASME B18.2.1 and ASTM F593

Lag Screws are used to fasten wood-to-wood and metal-to-wood, attach objects to wood, and affix items to concrete and masonry when combined with lag expansion shields. They are heavy-duty wood screws that are available in larger sizes both in terms of diameter and length and usually have a hex head to facilitate higher installation torque using a wrench. While lateral strength is lower than a comparable bolt and nut, lag screws are useful when access to one side of the joint is limited, the appearance of a nut is undesirable or through-bolt length is excessive.

Hex bolts are one of the most common fasteners and can be used in a wide variety of applications. The 6 sided head makes them easy to install using a standard wrench or socket tool. Nuts and washers are not included, so will need to be purchased separately. Washers help to evenly distribute the load and should always be used under the bolt head and under the nut (just under the bolt head if installing into a threaded hole). Flat washers and finished/standard hex nuts work great for most applications, though if the bolt may be subject to excessive vibration, it is recommended that lock washers and lock nuts be used instead.
Highlights:
- Installs easily with most wrenches
- Designed to be used with the same sized nut
- Stainless steel construction offers rust-resistant performance

Washers help to evenly distribute the load and should always be used under the bolt head and under the nut (just under the bolt head if installing into a threaded hole). Flat washers and finished/standard hex nuts work great for most applications, though if the bolt may be subject to excessive vibration, it is recommended that lock washers and lock nuts be used instead.

Hardware / Fasteners / Screws / Lag Bolts,Hillman,3655,5/16 in. x 1-1/4 in. External Hex Hex-Head Lag Screws (8-Pack),5/16 in~~1-1/4 in~~8,https://www.homedepot.com/p/Hillman-5-16-in-x-1-1-4-in-External-Hex-Hex-Head-Lag-Screws-8-Pack-3655/204795092,"About This Product
Lag Screws are used to fasten wood-to-wood and metal-to-wood, attach objects to wood, and affix items to concrete and masonry when combined with lag expansion shields. They are heavy-duty wood screws that are available in larger sizes both in terms of diameter and length and usually have a hex head to facilitate higher installation torque using a wrench. While lateral strength is lower than a comparable bolt and nut, lag screws are useful when access to one side of the joint is limited, the appearance of a nut is undesirable or through-bolt length is excessive.
Highlights:
- Made of sturdy stainless steel; for use in pre-drilled holes
- Hex head enables higher installation torque using a simple wrench
- 8-pack 5/16 in. x 1-1/4 in. external hex-head lag screws
Hex head is easily driven with simple wrenches and requires minimal clearance above the fastener Common applications include retaining walls, deck frames, and outdoor play equipment Stainless-steel material Use in pre-drilled hole

These hex bolts have hexagonal heads and are for general purpose applications with a socket type installation tool or standard wrench. The standard bolt is compatible with standard nuts and washers of the same thread pitch, grade, and finish. Grade-8 bolts have a higher strength and are to be used with Grade-8 nuts. An alternative for using hex bolts without nuts is to place them directly into a compatible female threaded receptacle. They require a pre drilled hole or pre-tapped hole with compatible female thread. Available in various materials, grades, and finishes.

15-pieces per pack Steel construction Galvanized finish 1/4-20 in. x 6 in. Coarse thread
